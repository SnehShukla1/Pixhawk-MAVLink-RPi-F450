# Pixhawk-MAVLink-RPi-F450
A complete, reproducible build of an autonomous quadcopter using an F450 frame, Pixhawk 2.4.8 (ArduCopter), and a Raspberry Pi 3B+ companion computer over MAVLink. This repo focuses on wiring and software bring-up (DroneKit + MAVProxy), with example scripts for GUIDED flight, mission upload, and telemetry logging.
